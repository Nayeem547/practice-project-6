      <p>Certainly, here are explanations for the scope of <span>var,</span> <span>let,</span> and <span>const,</span> as well as the use cases of <span>null</span> and <span>undefined,</span> followed by a brief note on REST APIs:</p>

    <div>
        <h2>Scope of var, let, and const:</h2>
         
        <div class="answer_div">
            <h3>var:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><span>var</span> has function-level scope. It's only limited to the function it is declared in, and it can also be hoisted to the top of the function. </li>
                <li>When declared outside any function, it becomes a global variable, accessible throughout the entire program. </li>
                <li>Variables declared with var are function-scoped, which means they are not restricted by block statements (e.g., <span>if</span> or <span>for</span> blocks).</li>
                
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="answer_div">
            <h3>Let:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><span>let</span> has block-level scope. It is confined to the block it's defined in (like loops or conditionals).</li>
                <li>Variables declared with <span>let</span> are not hoisted to the top of the block and are only accessible within that block.</li>
                <li><span>let</span> allows you to create variables that are limited to a specific block, making it useful for preventing variable leakage.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
      
        <div class="answer_div">
            <h3>const:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><span>const</span> also has block-level scope, similar to <span>let</span>.</li>
                <li>The key difference is that <span>const</span> variables cannot be reassigned once they are given a value. However, the content of a <span>const</span> object (if it's an object or array) can be modified.</li>
                
            </ul>
        </div>
      


    </div>
       
    <div class="null_div">
        <h2>Use Cases of null and undefined:</h2>

        <div class="answer_div">
            <h3>null:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>null represents the intentional absence of any object value or a specific object value that is intentionally empty.</li>
                <li>It's often used to initialize variables or object properties when you want to indicate that they have no value yet.</li>
               
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="answer_div">
            <h3>undefined:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>undefined represents the absence of a value in a variable that has been declared but not assigned any value.</li>
                <li>It's also the default return value of functions without a return statement.</li>
                <li>It can indicate a variable's initial state before a value is assigned.</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>REST API (Representational State Transfer):</h2>
        <div class="answer_div">
            <p><span>REST API,</span> or Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface, is a set of architectural principles and constraints for designing networked applications. Here's a brief note:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>REST is an architectural style for designing networked applications based on a client-server model. </li>
                <li>It uses standard HTTP methods like GET (retrieve), POST (create), PUT (update), and DELETE (delete) to perform operations on resources.</li>
                <li>Resources, represented as URLs, are the key abstractions in RESTful APIs.</li>
                <li>REST APIs are stateless, meaning each request from a client to the server must contain all the information needed to understand and process the request.</li>
                <li>Responses from the server are typically in JSON or XML format.</li>
                <li>RESTful APIs are widely used for building web services, web applications, and mobile apps due to their simplicity and scalability.</li>
            </ul>
